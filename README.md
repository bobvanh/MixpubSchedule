# MixpubSchedule

Here's some quick and dirty code to fill in the google docs sheet for the
MixPub schedule. 

The schedule centers around the days of the week taking into account the
occurence of that day within the month.

Ideally I'd like to write this within Google docs using the docs API, eg:

https://developers.google.com/apps-script/overview

For now this does the job `;)`
